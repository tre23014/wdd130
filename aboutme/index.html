    <h2>Victoria Tremelling</h2>
    <h2>My nickname is Tori</h2>
    <p>My name is Tori Tremelling. I am at BYUI for a Bachalors in 
        Software Engineering and love coding. I will spend 2 years 
        at BYU Idaho to get that degree. </p> 
    <p>I am 18 years old and love to craft a lot. I love any kind of craft however, one of my 
        favorites is Diamond Dotz. I also love reading and seeing 
        the different worlds people can come up with. I am currently 
        working at Chick-fil-A of Ammon and have been working there 
        for the last 3 years. I have also become a Team Leader at my 
        Chick-fil-A and still plan to work throughout the semester.  </p>
    <p>I am currently loving BYUI and love the way we intergate church. 
        I hope to one day work out at the Site/INL. I hope to learn 
        how to create web pages and code better than I do now. I have 
        been a member of the Church for my whole life and one of my 
        favorite scriptures is Pslam 28:7 "The Lord is my strngth 
        and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: 
        therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth..." </p>
    <p>One last fact about me is I have Type 1 Diabetes. I have lived with T1D for the last 12 years.</p>
